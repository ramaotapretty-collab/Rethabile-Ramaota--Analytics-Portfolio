# Rethabile Ramaota - Analytics Portfolio

Hi! I'm Rethabile,a teacher and aspiring data analyst with a strong academic foundation in research, data interpretation, and evaluation. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of the Western Cape, where I majored in Psychology, Geography, and History.

I later enhanced these skills through a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (History), where assessment, evaluation, and evidence-based decision-making is important.
